# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression implementation in python.
<br></br>
In this project, a logistic regression model has been developed for the [Bank Note Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) using gradient descent method. Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-score values have been calculated. L1 and L2 regularisation has been implemented to explore the effect of regularisation on accuracy and magnitude of weights.
